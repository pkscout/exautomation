# ACT SOURCE CONFIGURATION
# Still working on the ACT process.  I mean seriously, who still emails notifications and then tells you to download PGP files???
# Right now ACT is probably going to be a smb source for us where Admissions puts the decrypted text file
# Later this tool might do the decryption too, but I'll probably never add the pieces needed to read the notification email
